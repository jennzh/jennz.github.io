							<p>The parameters of this project aim to address an important topic related to health and well-being. Getting quality sleep has been shown to improve physical and mental health. For 10 weeks, my Human Computer Interaction project group worked to create a solution to the following problem:</p>
									
							<h2 id="center-text">"How do we help encourage young working Americans to improve their sleeping habits and counteract sleep deprivation?"</h2>
										
							 <!-- Competitive Analysis -->
							 <section>
								<h3>Competitive Analysis:</h3>
								<p id="center-text">To better analyze our <strong>problem statement</strong>, we culminated research on other sleep tracking applications to study existing solutions and potential weaknesses.</p>
								<div class="center-container">
									<a class="image"><img src="images/proj01/p01img01.png" style="max-width:50%;" alt="" class="proj-image center-image" /></a>
								</div>
								<p>One significant gap identified across the various apps we each analyzed is their potential underutilization by the target audience of young working-class Americans. The apps all aimed to reach a general audience, rather than targeting a specific group. While these apps provide good features for monitoring and analyzing sleep patterns, they fall short of addressing the unique challenges faced by the targeted group. This includes issues such as work-related stress, irregular schedules, or lifestyle factors that significantly impact sleep quality. Furthermore, the apps fail to address the multiple possible circumstances that would affect an individualâ€™s sleep. Thus, they end up giving out general information as a one-size-fits-all model. </p>

								<h3>User Research:</h3>
								<p id="center-text">We then each conducted interviews with young, working professionals ranging from full-time students with part-time internships to full-time working individuals. <br> We found these common patterns from participants:</p>

								<h4>Key Insights:</h4>
								<h5> People are too glued to their phones to fall asleep in a timely manner. </h5>
								<p> Nearly 83% of college students use their cell phones within 1 hour of going to bed, and around 66% check their cell phone notifications before getting out of bed in the morning<sup>1</sup>.</p>
								<h5>People who drink caffeine throughout the day have trouble falling asleep at night.</h5>
								<p> Stimulants, such as coffee, should be avoided before sleep. It's recommended to refrain from consuming caffeine 3 to 6 hours before bedtime, depending on the amount ingested<sup>2</sup>.</p>
								<h5>Trouble with sleeping due to changing work schedules. </h5>
								<p>Individuals working traditional 9-to-5 shifts are usually awake during daylight hours, which aligns with their body's natural circadian rhythms. However, for shift workers, their work and sleep schedules often conflict with the natural cues for wakefulness and sleep<sup>3</sup>.</p>
								<p id="center-text">From these insights, we were able to create personas.</p>

								<h3>Mockups:</h3> 
								<!-- possibly create a toggle option to see the type of mockups: low-fi, mid-fi, high-fi, storyboards -->
								
								<h4>Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
								<p id="center-text">With the user research we gathered and the personas we created, we highlighted the most common user needs and traits. Each team member then drew up low-fi prototypes based on these insights to communicate relevant features that could be included in the design of our app.</p>
								<div class="proj-section center-container">					
									<a class="image"><img src="images/proj01/p01img11.png" style="max-width:35%;" alt="" class="proj-image center-image" /></a>
								</div>
								<p>This interface layout will display the app's core features. The three main icons that show upon scrolling will lead to more detailed pages of the app's main features.</p>
								
								<h4>Mid-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
								<p id="center-text">After creating our low-fidelity prototypes separately, we gathered to compare ideas regarding the functionalities we made. </p>
								<div class="proj-section">
									<figure>
										<figcaption id="center-text">Figure 1 - Schedule</figcaption>
										<a class="image"><img src="images/proj01/p01img12.png" alt="" class="proj-image" /></a>
									</figure>
									<figure>
										<figcaption id="center-text">Figure 2 - Screen Lock</figcaption>
										<a class="image"><img src="images/proj01/p01img13.png" alt="" class="proj-image" /></a>

										<figcaption id="center-text">Figure 3- Food Suggestions</figcaption>
										<a class="image"><img src="images/proj01/p01img14.png" alt="" class="proj-image" /></a>
									</figure>
								</div>
								<div>
									<p> <em>(1)</em> This prototype assists in creating schedules based on the user's wake-up times. Users can input their daily tasks, and the app will generate a personalized schedule around these times, including recommended wake-up times. </p>
									<p> <em>(2)</em> This prototype aims to help users reduce device usage before bedtime by locking their phones and other devices for a specified duration. Users can set the lock duration and will be presented with a confirmation screen to ensure they want to proceed with locking their devices.</p>
									<p> <em>(3)</em> This prototype displays a list of scientifically proven foods that are beneficial or detrimental to consume before bed.Additionally, the app will feature daily rotating food-related quotes to provide helpful insights for users.</p>
								</div>
							</section>

							<h4>High-Fidelity Prototypes</h4>
							<p id="center-text">Next, we expanded on each concept from our initial storyboards and prototypes. The following prototypes were developed based on our mid-fidelity sketches.</p>
						
							<section class="iframe-wrapper">
								<div class="iframe-container">
									<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fdesign%2F6FvI8UuMmH8ANCvuErsmZm%2F%255BINF-132%255D-O.O.F-App-Design-Prototypes%3Fnode-id%3D56795-25394%26t%3DTsS6NQiT2myR1tqi-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
								</div>
							</section>
							<h5 id="center-text"><br>Usability Evaluation</h5>
							<p>
								Throughout this process, we engaged in a peer review to evaluate our prototypes and determine if the interface allowed participants to effectively perform their tasks, identifying what was clear and unclear. This usability evaluation highlighted several areas for improvement to enhance user understanding and interaction with the interface. By addressing these issues and implementing the suggested changes, the interface will become more user-friendly and intuitive.

									<a class="image"><img src="images/proj01/p01img32.png" alt="" class="proj-image"/></a>
								</figure>
							</div>
							<div>
								<p> <em>(4)</em> An indicator for navigating the homepage proved to be useful in helping users understand how to properly use the app. We enhanced this by adding a subtle line of text with an arrow, providing clear instructions on how to locate the rest of the page's components. </p>
								<p> <em>(5)</em> To clarify the purpose of each page and the meaning of each icon, we added a feature where hovering over an icon displays a summary of the page's content. This ensures that users are fully aware of what to expect when they press the button to navigate to a specific screen.</p>
						
							</div>
							<p>
								<br>
								Our final prototype of the app was taking what we had for our high fidelity and making the pages more visually clear based on feedback we received.
